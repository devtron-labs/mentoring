# Contributor Guide: Google Summer of Code (GSoC)

Are you a student, an early professional, or a beginner in open-source looking to gain real-world experience working on projects that software professionals and non-tech folks alike widely use? Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is an open-source mentoring program where you will collaborate with industry experts across various domains to build meaningful projects that will be used in the real world.

## What is Google Summer of Code?

[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a global, online program focused on bringing new contributors into open-source software development. GSoC contributors work with an open-source organization on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance of mentors from specific organizations.

The program began in 2005 and, until 2021, focused on bringing university students into open-source. Starting in 2022, the program has expanded to welcome students and all beginner contributors to open source who are 18 years and older. These GSoC contributors will write code and become part of open-source communities while earning some money along the way.

If you would like to contribute to Google Summer of Code and are new to open source, please check out the [Student/Contributor guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/).
